One day, Ismail throws a bat to Jamila because she complained about him to her mother. Dilara, having learned about this, punishes the naughty boy. Ismail's opinion about his stepmother begins to change when he sees how she saved the life of a seriously ill man. He secretly does his homework and gradually gets used to the new \"mother\". During another children's fun - a game of racing - Ismail invites Jamila to cross the river, and the girl, having fallen into the water, catches a severe cold. Ismail is tormented by conscience. But then he recalls how his grandmother (played by Hagigat Rzayeva) treated him, giving him tea from a wild rose growing in the mountains. Ismail rushes to the mountains, not knowing that explosive work is being carried out there to build a road. Dilyara finds out where Ismail ran and runs after him, but does not have time. During the explosion, Ismail is seriously injured. Having lost a lot of blood, Ismail is on the verge of death. But Dilara gives him a blood transfusion, thereby saving his life. Waking up, Ismail hugs Dilara, calling her mom, not stepmother, as he did before.",

Ismail is a well-known mischievous person in the village and teases Jamila all the time, but does not like his stepmother. But he begins to hate her even more after Dilyara shows his father Ismail's school diary, in which there are only deuces. For this, Ismail's father, Arif (played by Fateh Fatullayev), does not take Ismail with him to the mountains, where he supervises the construction of the road.  One day, Ismail throws a bat to Jamila because she complained about him to her mother. Dilara, having learned about this, punishes the naughty boy. Ismail's opinion about his stepmother begins to change when he sees how she saved the life of a seriously ill man. He secretly does his homework and gradually gets used to the new \"mother\". During another children's fun - a game of racing - Ismail invites Jamila to cross the river, and the girl, having fallen into the water, catches a severe cold. Ismail is tormented by conscience.
